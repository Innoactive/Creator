## Add Transitions

To add a transition in the Step Inspector, click on the `Add Transition` button. It will point to the end of the chapter by default. To choose another destination, see [the article about Workflow Editor](workflow-editor.md#add-transitions).

Make sure that every step has at least one transition. Otherwise, the training course will not proceed past that step.
