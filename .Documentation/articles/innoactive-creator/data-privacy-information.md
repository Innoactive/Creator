# A message from Innoactive about data privacy

The Innoactive Creator collects anonymous usage data if you are a user of the Unity plugin and accepted the collection of data. We collect this information to improve the usage of the Creator.

### Information we obtain from these devices include:

**Device attributes:** information such as system language, Unity version and Innoactive Creator version

**Usage data:** information about how you use the application. The day of first session and the day of last session.

Innoactive also uses the data to tune the Unity plugin for users. Innoactive is commited to the responsible collection and use of user data - and enhancing privacy safeguards.

You can at any time change the settings of the collection of user data in Unity in the Analytics Settings (Innoactive > Creator > Windows > Analytics Settings).
