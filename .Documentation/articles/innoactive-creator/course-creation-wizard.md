## Create a New Training Course

In the `Training Course Wizard` window you can set the `Training Course Name` for a new training course. It will also be the filename. You can change the name later in the [Workflow Editor](workflow-editor.md).
This new training course will be the active training course for the currently opened scene. You can also change the active training course later in the [Training Configuration](training-configuration.md).


Finally, click on the `Create` button to create the new training course.

## Error: The Current Scene Is Not a Training Scene

If the `The current scene is not a training scene` error message appears in the `Training Course Wizard`, please make sure your training scene is loaded or setup the current scene as training scene by selecting `Innoactive` > `Creator` > `Setup Training Scene` in Unity's toolbar.
