# Introduction

A virtual reality training application guides a user through a course, which is a set of instructions and tasks. An application consists of scripts and assets.

When your team works on such an application, the Innoactive Creator helps you with two common tasks. You can use our visual editor to define a training course, or, if you are a programmer, you can write new scripts using our SDK.

We do not help to create new assets, but we provide ways to integrate them.

We distinguish two user groups for our product: training designers, who work with the visual editor, and template developers, who provide training designers with templates. A template is a package of scripts and assets which serve as building blocks for training courses. You can reuse a template for multiple training applications.

Training designers work closely with trainers or they are trainers themselves. They need to know our tool and the Unity Editor, but they do not have to be programmers. Template developers need to know both Unity and programming.

Our users need Unity skills because the Innoactive Creator extends Unity. Our tool is free, open-source, and you can use it alongside any other Unity solution.

Tasks, processes, and use cases vary between companies, and the difference is even stronger between industries. This is why you need template developers in your team: because your company needs a custom template.

You could create a template from scratch, or you could use the Innoactive's default template as a starting point.
