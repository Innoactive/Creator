# XR Interaction Toolkit

The Innoactive Creator is bundled with the [`XR Interaction Component`](https://github.com/Innoactive/XR-Interaction-Component) an interaction implementation based on the [`XR Interaction Toolkit`](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/12/17/xr-interaction-toolkit-preview-package-is-here/), an XR interaction framework made by Unity and defined as follows:

> The XR Interaction Toolkit package is a high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains helper components that you can use to extend functionality for drawing visuals and hooking in your own interaction events.

The XR Interaction Toolkit is used along with the [`XR Plugin Management`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.management@3.2/manual/index.html) to enable XR content creators to build applications in an abstract layer without dealing with hardware or software specifics, speeding up the development process. In other words, an XR application is developed once and can be exported to as many end hardware as desired.
