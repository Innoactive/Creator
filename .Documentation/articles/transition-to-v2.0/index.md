# The Transition Guide from v1.X to v2.0

This guide is for developers who have used the Innoactive Creator v1.X and wish to try out the preview release of the Innoactive Creator v2.0. You will learn about the upcoming changes and how to convert your code to the new API.

We have released the preview version to collect your feedback before making the changes final. Please, send it to your contact person at Innoactive or directly to our [support portal](https://jira.innoactive.de/servicedesk/customer/portal/3). Of course, it means that the public API could change once more when we make the actual release.

We have extended the Innoactive Creator with new features and made it easier to use. Every concept that you have learned still applies to the new version.

We recommend to develop new training applications with v2.0 when we will make it ready for production. We recommend to still use v1.3.1 for existing projects.

We have split this guide in three chapters: [Overview of the Changes](01-overview-of-the-changes.md), [Update Behaviors and Conditions](02-update-behaviors-and-conditions.md), and [Unity XR FAQ](03-unity-xr-faq.md).
