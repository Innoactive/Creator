# The Transition Guide from v1.X to v2.0

The new version of Creator made it easier to use and brought new features. Every concept that you have learned still applies, but the new API reflects some of them in a different way. This guide highlights what has changed, and helps you to convert existing behaviors, conditions, and properties to the new API.

We have split this guide in three chapters: [Overview of the Changes](01-overview-of-the-changes.md), [Update Behaviors and Conditions](02-update-behaviors-and-conditions.md), and [Unity XR FAQ](03-unity-xr-faq.md).

We recommend to develop new training applications with v2.0, but continue to use the Creator v1.3.1 with existing projects.
