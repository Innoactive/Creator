# The Transition Guide from v1.X to v2.0

We have written this section for template developers who have already worked with the Innoactive Creator before. This section prepares you to the changes of the v2.0, and if you have never worked with the Innoactive Creator before, you should start with the updated [developer's tutorial](../developer/index.md) instead.

We have added new features to the Innoactive Creator and made it easier to use and extend. Every concept that you have learned still applies, but the new API reflects them in a different way. This guide highlights what has changed, and helps you to convert existing behaviors, conditions, and properties to the new API.

We have split this guide in three chapters: [Overview of the Changes](01-overview-of-the-changes.md), [Update Behaviors and Conditions](02-update-behaviors-and-conditions.md), and [Unity XR FAQ](03-unity-xr-faq.md).

We recommend to develop new training applications with v2.0, but continue to use the Creator v1.3.1 with existing projects.
