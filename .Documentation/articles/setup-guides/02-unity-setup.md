The synergy from the both products lets you to create VR training applications fast. Unity provides technical foundation, and our tool focuses on creation of training courses.

## Install Unity Hub

There are several Unity versions and ways to download and install them. We recommend to use the Unity Hub. It is a standalone application that streamlines the process of finding, downloading, and managing your Unity projects and installations.  

Download the Unity Hub from [unity3d.com](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), install, and launch it. Upon the first launch, the Unity Hub will ask you to activate your Unity license. You need to log in into your Unity account. If you do not have one, you can sign up there for free.

Learn more about the Unity Hub in the Unity Technologies's [Getting Started](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html) guide.

## Download Unity Using the Unity Hub

As we just installed the Unity Hub, the `Projects` and `Installs` sections should be empty. Go to `Installs`, then click `Add`, and select `Unity 2019.4 LTS`. Continue with the install wizard using the default configuration.

Once you have installed the Unity Editor, you can create a new project or load an existing one.

To create a new project, go to the `Projects` tab and then click at the `New` button. A configuration window will pop up. Select 3D from the list of templates, pick a good name for your project, and set the location for it. Click `Create`, and Unity will create a new project and open it in the Editor.

If you have installed multiple Unity versions, click the triangle next to the `New` button in the `Projects` tab. There you can select which Unity version to use with the new project.

If you want to load an existing project, go to the `Projects` tab and click the `Add` button. Select the containing folder of that project. Unity will add the project to the `Projects` list.

Every time you create or load a project with the Unity Hub, it will add the project to the `Projects` list. From now on, just click on a project to open it with the Unity Editor.
