# System Setup

The Innoactive Creator is an extension for the Unity Editor, and the Unity Editor supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS. We recommend you to use Windows 10 though, as our test machines and most of our developers' work stations run Windows 10. We do not test the Creator for Linux or MacOS.

The Text-to-Speech component uses Microsoft Text to Speech by default. It requires Windows 10 with installed language packs for every language you want to use. You can add language packs through Windows settings: `Windows Settings` > `Time & Language` > `Language` > `Add a preferred language`.
