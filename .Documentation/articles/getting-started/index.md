# Getting Started

## Introduction

When people train in virtual reality, they wear special headsets to interact with a computer simulation. Unlike in a static picture or video, the environment responds to their actions. VR headsets and controllers feel more natural than a computer screen with a keyboard and mouse. Being engaged in a simulation, trainees do not occupy real production lines and machinery.

A virtual reality training application is a program that controls such a simulation. It guides a user through a course, which is a set of instructions and tasks. A course uses scripts and assets, where scripts are small reusable subprograms and assets are resources like 3D models, images, and sounds.

## Innoactive Creator

Our Innoactive Creator extends Unity, a tool that is commonly used for developing VR applications. You can use the Innoactive Creator alongside any other Unity solution. It is free and open-source.

We distinguish two user groups for our product: training designers and template developers. Training designers use our visual tool to describe training courses in a way that is similar to a natural thinking. They work closely with trainers or they are trainers themselves. Template developers provide training designers with templates. A template is a package of scripts and assets that serve as building blocks for training courses. You can reuse a template for multiple training applications.

The Innoactive Creator does not help to create new assets, but provides ways to integrate them.

Your team would include both training designers and template developers. Training designers need to know our tool and the Unity Editor, but they do not need to be programmers. Template developers need to know both Unity and programming.

## Further Steps

If you want to see if the Innoactive Creator fits your team, follow [this guide](evaluator.md) to set up a demo project. If you want to use the Innoactive Creator in production, see [the instructions for designers](designer.md). If you are a developer, see [this page](developer.md) to create a new template project.
