# Getting Started as a Developer

Follow the [template developer's tutorial](../developer/index.md). It explains how to extend the Innoactive Creator by creating custom templates.

This tutorial is intended for developers who already know C# and scripting in Unity. We have prepared a list of external resources where you can learn it.

## Learning C\#

Microsoft's documentation on C# is remarkably good. Read "Learn to program in C#" and "C# fundamentals" sections first, and then continue with articles about generics and iterators. It could take a day or two.

1. [Iterators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/iterators)

## Learning Unity

Unity Technologies provides free manuals and tutorials as well, and you can order a live workshop from one of their partners. One dedicated day of studying Unity will suffice.
