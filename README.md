# Innoactive Creator

A Unity based training application creation framework.

The Innoactive Creator helps you to train employees in VR in a safe and cost-effective way. With our tool, you can design training processes inside the Unity Editor with no programming at all. As a developer, you can configure it with custom templates and extend it with separate components.

Easiest way to start is trying out the [Creator package](https://www.innoactive.io/creator) which includes additional features to speed up your training creation.

**Note:** The Creator is built to work with Unity 2019.4.X LTS version to compile on a Windows 10 machine, and supports applications for Windows and Android based Standalone devices.
